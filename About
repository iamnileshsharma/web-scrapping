🚀 Just Built a Python Web Scraper to Track BBC News Headlines! 🐍

I created a script that automatically extracts and saves the latest headlines from BBC News using Python! Here's how it works:

✨ **What it does**:
- Fetches real-time news data from BBC’s homepage.
- Saves headlines, summaries, and timestamps to a file.
- Built with `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for scraping.

🔧 **Tech Stack**:
- Python
- Requests (HTTP library)
- BeautifulSoup (HTML parsing)
- Datetime (for timestamps)

💡 **Why I built this**:
- To practice web scraping and automation.
- Demonstrate data extraction skills for real-world applications.
